# 3025RimwardPeriphery
 
Welcome!

The Rimward Periphery initiative is a major part of Interstellar Expeditions astronavigational research efforts conducted by our volunteers and is dedicated to providing an extensive and accurate star system database available to the general public, and as a supplement of the official navigational charts provided by ComStar.

The project was born from the initial cartography effort made by the Hyades Rim mod, which took Morphyum's original work on the Inner Sphere Map mod (https://github.com/Morphyum/InnerSphereMap) as an inspiration to create an different and smaller scaled map. As the mod kept increasing to more than 200 systems, I decided to separate them and make all of the new star system available just using the base game, with a standalone version free to download and use with other mods.

Features
This project adds about 400 new playable systems to the existing Rimward Periphery star map, divided into several subgroups of worlds:
* Davion: 70 habitable systems, 14 abandoned, includes New Syrtis
* Hyades Rim: 51 habitable/abandoned, includes Badlands, Erod's Escape and Randis IV
* Hyades Rim (new): 25 habitable/abandoned, all original systems
* Liao: 29 habitable, 17 abandoned, includes Grand Base, Betelgeuse and Warlock
* Magistracy: 32 habitable, 28 abandoned
* Marian Hegemony: 12 habitable
* Marik: 65 habitable, 19 abandoned, includes Andurien
* Marshes: 4 habitable/abandoned, includes Astrokazky and Niops
* Marshes (new): 14 habitable/abandoned, all original systems
* Outer Rim: original systems used to mark the outer map border, unplayable
* Taurian: 14 habitable, 8 abandoned
* Undiscovered: 10 habitable/abandoned, Deep Periphery worlds

All of the new systems use the base factions, in the future new canon factions may be added: political entities like the Duchy of Andurien, Capellan March or Marian Hegemony; or special operations teams like the DEST, Death Commandos and Rabid Foxes. 

Help Wanted
This initiative is also open for anyone to participate by updating the current systems, or to expand the map by adding new ones, and be properly credited for any contributions. However, the intention of this project is not to display the entire Inner Sphere and Periphery, but to focus on its rimward areas. 

However, one possible future idea would be to expand the map to include Atreus, Sian and St. Ives, along with the Tortuga Dominions, Lothian League and Illyrian Palatinate by adding 200 to 300 additional systems to the current existing ones.
